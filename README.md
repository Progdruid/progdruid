### Hej! I'm Druid or Zack if you want. :wave:

- :ukraine: I'm a Ukrainian indie game developer and programmer. 
- :toolbox: Worked with C#, Unity, .Net, libGDX(Java), OpenGL, GLSL & other.
- :mag: Searching for great tools to work with.
- :joystick: Finished game projects:
  - [Coffee Cave](https://progdruid.itch.io/coffee-cave) - a 2d puzzle-platformer with an interesting mechanic. Here is a [repo](https://github.com/progdruid/bwj-0.9).
- :art: Curious about procedural generation and generative things. My generative labour:
  - [Artworks](https://github.com/progdruid/artworks) - minor works united in one repo.
  - [Little Drill Miner](https://github.com/progdruid/little-drill-miner) - starbound/terraria-like underworld map generation.
  - [Hydraulic Erosion](https://github.com/progdruid/hydraulic-erosion) - simulation of mountain hydraulic erosion.
- :zap: You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/progdruid), [Itch.io](https://progdruid.itch.io/), [Medium](https://progdruid.medium.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProgrammingDruid/)
