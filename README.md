### Hej! I'm Druid or Zak if you want. :wave:

- :ukraine: I'm a Ukrainian indie game developer and programmer. 
- :scotland: Currently in Scotland. You know why...
- :toolbox: Worked with C#, Unity, .Net, libGDX(Java) & other.
- :mag: Searching for great people and technologies to work with.
- :gear: Right now I'm developing a game that is called [Polymort](https://github.com/progdruid/polymort) and will be released on Android platform pretty soon.
- :joystick: Finished games:
  - [Polymort](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ProgrammingDruid.Polymort) - a continuation of [Coffee Cave](https://progdruid.itch.io/coffee-cave) successfully shipped on Google Play. Here is a [repo](https://github.com/progdruid/polymort).
  - [Coffee Cave](https://progdruid.itch.io/coffee-cave) - a 2d puzzle-platformer with an interesting mechanic.
- :art: Curious about procedural generation and generative things. My generative labour:
  - [Little Drill Miner](https://github.com/progdruid/little-drill-miner) - starbound/terraria-like underworld map generation.
  - [Hydraulic Erosion](https://github.com/progdruid/hydraulic-erosion) - simulation of mountain hydraulic erosion.
  - [Artworks](https://github.com/progdruid/artworks) - minor works united in one repo.
- :rocket: It also did some low level things:
  - [Rocket Lab](https://github.com/progdruid/rocket-lab) - an extremely simple "game" with an own simple renderer written in [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx).
- :zap: You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/progdruid), [Itch.io](https://progdruid.itch.io/), [Medium](https://progdruid.medium.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProgrammingDruid/)
