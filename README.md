- :computer: Currently working with Unity, C# and .Net, but can switch technologies soon.
- :toolbox: Searching for great tools to work with.
- :art: I worked with procedural generation and generative things:

  - [Hydraulic Erosion](https://github.com/Progdruid/HydraulicErosion)
- :zap: You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/progdruid), [Medium](https://progdruid.medium.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProgrammingDruid/)
- :copyright: This approach is not nice, not flexible, and not object-oriented at all.
